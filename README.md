This project showcases a smart Restaurant Chatbox built using HTML. The chatbox acts as a virtual assistant for customers, helping them with quick reservations, menu inquiries, order placements, and FAQs. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface that makes online engagement simple and efficient. Designed with a modern UI, it includes welcome messages, instant replies, and a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile users. The main goal of this project is to improve customer experience by offering 24/7 support, reducing staff workload, and streamlining table bookings and food orders.
